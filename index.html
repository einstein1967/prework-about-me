      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am looking to become a web developer via this bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Missouri and raised in northern MN.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies include spending time with my family and working/playing on almost any electronic device.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It is difficult to say at this time. In theory, this bootcamp will drastically change what my idea of a 'Dream Job' is.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the eastern suburbs of of St. Paul.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Programming was my first true passion (of course, every kid's first passion is paleontology). I unfortunately steered
        away from that at some point, but I'm now taking steps to correct my course back to it.
